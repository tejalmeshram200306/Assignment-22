        <h2>About JuicyFresh</h2>
        <p>
          JuicyFresh was founded in 2020 by a group of juice enthusiasts who
          wanted to bring healthy and delicious juices to the community. Our
          journey started with a small juice stand at the local farmers' market,
          and now we've grown into a beloved juice center known for our quality
          and taste.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that juice should be more than just a drink â€“ it should be
          an experience. That's why we take great care in selecting the finest
          ingredients and crafting each juice with love.
